1. **["Write the Paper First" ](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/advice/write-the-paper-first.html) by Jason Eisner (2010)**

  


   - A collection of deep insights about impact and importance of good writing. Anyone in research (or not) with an inclination towards novel ideas rather than conducting experiments will love this article. Here is one of my favorite lines from the article: 


   > "You can hack on little sleep, if you know what needs to be hacked. But you can't write effectively. Writing involves many big and small decisions, which will seem insurmountable when you're exhausted and panicked."

   -  Here is one more to motivate you to read this article:
   > " Five students can be hacking in parallel at the last minute, but they can't all be co-writing with me at the last minute. You have your own computer but you have to share your advisor."
